## Profiler

Counts the execution of every statement in a BASIC program except `DEF FN`, `DATA` and `NEXT` and colors the most frequently executed statements **red**, those executed at least 1/10 times as frequently **yellow**, those not executed at all **blue** and everything else **green**. Helps finding the hottest part in your program.
